Side Project: App for listing/providing emergency accommodation during natural disasters.

Why:
* I started this project after hearing of the numbers of people displaced after widespread flooding and bushfires.
  People were offering accommodation to those in need, but the information wasn't reaching those that needed it and there was no organized system.
  While i was working on this project, Airbnb came out with a similar idea, so i stopped working on this. However more recently there has been some backlash against them   and possible regulatory restrictions/requirements. This could unintentionally affect the emergency housing sector, so I have decided to continue work on the app    whenever i have time. 

What the app does:
* Allows people to voluntarily list space: house/room/caravan/tent etc for those in need and volunteers/emergency personnel during a natural disaster.
* Listings can be added, removed, edited.
* For profit is not allowed. A small reasonable fee to cover cleaning MAY be allowed. This will be capped to prevent abuse.
* Those in need of accommodation can reserve available accommodation through non profit partners or use the app to find suitable non profit partners.
* An organizational tool for non profits to help the temporarily displaced.


What the app won't do:
* It is not intended to be used for finding accommodation for people who become homeless in normal situations. There are already many non profits that provide assistance for this situation.
* It is not a rental tool.
* When i eventually finish this, it will be non profit with advertising covering the cost of maintaining the site or from my own pocket. The site will not accept donations. If there appears to be a need for funding, i will just hand ownership of the App to a suitable non profit. 

Deployment instructions:
* Not ready for deployment!

Note: I have very limited time to devote to this project, so it will likely be some time before it goes live.
